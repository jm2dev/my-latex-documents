* Abstract

LaTeX2e beamer presetation about sbt build tool.

* Motivation

Starting with a new software language can be a frustrating experience
when you feel lost among the new tools and possibilities that appear
in front of you.

In order to mitigate that frustation I decided to prepare a short
presentation about my own experiences and want to share that new
knowledge with others.

Having a java background and being used to maven, I really missed some
features I gave for granted with sbt. Giter8 has filled the gap around
maven archetypes I used to invoque a lot when I built any java project
from scratch.

Additionally, as I like working on different unix flavours, I found
annoying the operating system package management dependency. Storing
all my applications in my home folder, although it can deal to
controversy, has simplified my workflow.
